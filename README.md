# My Personal Website
Description
This website is a way to try and describe myself
<ul>
  <li>HTML</li>
  <li> CSS</li>
  <li> JavaScript</li>
  <li> Google Font</li>
  <li> FreePik</li>
</ul>
Time and inadequate knowledge are some of the challenges I am facing. Learning JavaScript more will be an added advantage
